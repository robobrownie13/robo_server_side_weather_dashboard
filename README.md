# Server Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## User Story

AS A traveler <br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities <br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Features

With this project, the user first inputs a city name and is given the option of choosing the correct city, state, and country. Once the user submits their desired information, weather is retrieved for the current day as well as five days into the future. I utilized three api calls for city info, current weather, and the five day forecast. The searched cities are then saved in local storage and displayed as buttons on the screen when the webpage is refreshed.
